# KONAI üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: AURA FARMERS


### Team Members
- Team Lead: SATHYAKI VARMA - TKM COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING
- Member 2: ROHITH MAHESH- TKM COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING


### Project Description
Emotions, scripted

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People aren‚Äôt getting emotionally roasted or hyped up by Malayalam movie characters when they express how they feel online. That's a national crisis... if you think about it long enough.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made Konai, a website where Malayalam movie characters respond to your emotions with their funniest or most iconic dialogues. You type your feelings, Konai reads the vibe, and BOOM ‚Äî a meme-worthy voice line, plus a face to match. It's like therapy‚Ä¶ but with Mammootty.
